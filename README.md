# Shipping-Analysis

## Summary
Used python to transform and clean the 100k+ data set. Adding identifiers based on shipment (using a unique code of transaction date and location), and adding geolocation data from Google Maps API.

SQL queries were then used to filter it for relevant business insights.

## Data Set
Primary purpose of this data can be found at Shipping-Heatmap. As a bonus I was able to use this data for a database management course in my masters, which is what this repository is for.
